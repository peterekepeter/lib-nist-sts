# lib-nist-sts

*Currently still under development.*

Library of the NIST statistic tests for the modern world!

## Based on:

 - original statistic testing suite http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/documentation_software.html
 - optimizations by sysox https://github.com/sysox/NIST-STS-optimised

The original work is public domain, so assuming the optimisations are also under public domain, so will this library be public domain.
My intention is not to steal anyone's work, but to improve on it, so that it can be used more efficicenly. While the original works are excellent console applications, their code is not fit for including in other applications. I attempt to fix that.

## Goals:

 - thread safe
 - easy to use
 - x64 compatible
 - under unit tests
